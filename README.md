the documentation will be here, currently being worked on

some more info about this project: <br>
the point of this is to make a collection of keyboard layouts that me and maybe others can use, the thing that made me do this is how anoying it is to switch between 2 differend keyboards constantly when I need to type the czech diacritics but I don't remember the positions of other characters on the czech keyboard (e.g. ? ! @ / " ' and many more), yes i could just learn it but then when i use a differend computer that has the us layout on it I'll get confused, so I made this layout. <br>
I originally wanted to just add the diacritics and be done, but then I was like: "hmm this character is also useful, and maybe ill add that one too" and after a while i filled the whole keyboard with *definitly useful* characters and that became the main layout <br>
after I realized what I did, I made a variant called 'nobloat' that only has the czech diacritics on top of a us layout and nothing else
